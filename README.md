My objectives

1.     Evaluate campaign effectiveness across channels
2.     Determine the impact of campaign duration on the total number of ad clicks to optimize campaign length and maximize user engagement.

4.     Noting the relationship that exists between campaign season and likes. 

Key Insights
---
1. All three channels performed well with Instagram having the highest number of clicks of approximately 65.13k clicks. In the aspect of ROI, Instagram performed best, producing a profit of approximately 621.72k followed by Pinterest despite Pinterest having a lower number of ads and clicks compared to Facebook.

2. Ads displayed on Instagram and Facebook had more user engagements, having approximately 21 clicks/ads, whereas Pinterest had approximately 12 clicks/ads. This enables us to know what types of ads to display across these channels.

3i. Most users interacted with ads from mobile compared to desktop.
3ii. Likes don't necessarily amount to financial gain as seen in Aug 2023 & July 2023, where August had fewer likes compared to July, but was more profitable.

4. A high level of decline in likes was discovered during the summer campaign, this could have been as a result of posting ads of seasonal products.

Recommendations
---
1. Evaluation to be done on the types of ads displayed on Pinterest and Facebook to discover the reason behind lower clicks but higher profitability, this also enables us to know the reason behind the number of clicks/ ads.

2. Investment in ads for mobile users as it has more engagement thereby resulting in higher purchases. Evaluation of the types of ads displayed in both August 2023 and July 2023 to know what products customers preferred.
